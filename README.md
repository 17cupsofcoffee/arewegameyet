#### CONTRIBUTE
Arewegameyet? uses semantic-ui, and in the future it will use [cobalt-rs]() the Rust static site generator.
But at the moment cobalt is lacking the [data files](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/) feature that Jekyll has, and which a site like this need.
So, in classic yak shaving fashion, I'll have to add that before being able to automate the site.
Yes, I know I could use Jekyll, but I'd rather contribute to the Rust ecosystem.

##### Add a Library/Category
If you want to add a library please make an issue with the cargo url of the new library, or if you're comfortable with semantic-ui style html you can try a pull request.

##### Errors
It's very likely there are mistakes around, if you find please file an issue.

##### Keep your library's cargo data tidy
If you don't include your homepage/docs/repo on your library's cargo page they won't appear on Arewegameyet either.

Thanks.

## What is this?

The Rust community has a number of websites dedicated to keeping track of the state of the ecosystem for specific purposes. (e.g. [arewewebyet](http://www.arewewebyet.org) and [arewelearningyet](http://www.arewelearningyet.com))

This one tracks the state of the ecosystem for Game Development in Rust.

## Contribute
Arewegameyet? uses [semantic-ui](http://semantic-ui.com/), and [zola](https://github.com/getzola/zola) the Rust static site generator.

### Add a Library/Category
If you want to add a library please make an issue with the cargo url of the new library, or if you're comfortable with semantic-ui style html you can try a pull request.

### Errors
It's very likely there are mistakes around, if you find one please file an issue.

### Keep your library's cargo data tidy
If you don't include your homepage/docs/repo on your library's cargo page they won't appear on Arewegameyet either.

Thanks.
